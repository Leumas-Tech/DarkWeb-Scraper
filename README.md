# Darkweb Scraper :spider_web:

Welcome to the Darkweb Scraper project! This application is designed to scrape content from the dark web safely and anonymously using the Tor network. It's built on Node.js and uses Express for the web server framework and Axios for making HTTP requests through a Tor proxy.

## :gear: Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Tor Browser or Tor service running locally to route traffic through the Tor network.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
   git clone https://yourrepositorylink.com/darkweb-scraper.git
   cd darkweb-scraper
```

2 . **Install Dependencies**

```
npm install
```
3. **Configure Tor Proxy**
Ensure Tor is running on your system. This application is configured to use Tor's default SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1:9150. Adjust the torProxy variable in the code if your setup differs.

4. **Start the Application**

```
npm start
```
## Usage
Send a POST request to http://localhost:3010/scrape with a JSON body containing the URL you wish to scrape:

```
{
  "url": "http://darkwebonionlink.onion"
}
```
:bulb: How to Expand
Add More Routes: Implement additional routes for different scraping strategies or to handle specific content types.
Enhance Error Handling: Improve the application's resilience by handling more error scenarios gracefully.
User Interface: Consider adding a simple web interface to submit URLs and display scraped content.
Authentication: For public deployments, add authentication to restrict access to the scraping functionality.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your scraping service.
